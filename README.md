## Introduction

In today's digital world, managing passwords securely is essential. The **Password Manager** provides a simple yet powerful tool to help users create, store, and manage their passwords effectively. The app follows a modular MVC architecture, making it easy to maintain and extend.

## Features

- **Secure Random Password Generation**: Generate strong, random passwords to enhance security.
- **Expiration Tracking**: Monitor password expiration dates and receive alerts when it's time to update.
- **Customizable Search Functionality**: Quickly find passwords using flexible search options.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate the app with ease, thanks to a clean and intuitive UI.

## Architecture

The app follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, which separates the application logic from the user interface. This design choice promotes better organization and easier maintenance of the codebase.

- **Model**: Handles data and business logic.
- **View**: Manages the user interface and displays information.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, processing user input and updating the Model.

This architecture allows for easier updates and the addition of new features without disrupting existing functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for building the application.
- **JavaFX**: Provides the graphical user interface for the app.
- **AES Encryption**: Ensures that all stored passwords are encrypted and secure.
- **Gradle**: Manages project dependencies and builds.
- **Scrum Agile**: Used for project management and development processes.
